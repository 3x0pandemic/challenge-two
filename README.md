# Challenge Two

1. Setup
##### Clone the repository and from inside the repository directory run:
`npm install`

2. Finish the `POST` route for `/api/products`.
##### Use POSTMAN to create some products. Hint: Find the error in `models/product`

3. Fix `index.ejs` to render actual products from our database.
##### You will need to update the route in `server.js` that serves `index.ejs`.

4. Finish the AJAX method in `app.js` to allow us to create a new product with the form.
##### Watch out for incorrectly named variables.
